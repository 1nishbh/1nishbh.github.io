<p>By the time you enter the womb again, you understand as little about yourself as you did your first time here.</p>

<p>But the better yous are always in your face in the afterlife. In the bookstore you’ll see one of them arm in arm with the affectionate woman whom you let slip away.</p>

<p>If you assume this gift of revelation is received in Heaven, you’re only half right; it is also the punishment designed for you in Hell. The Rewarders originally thought to offer it as a gift, but the Punishers quickly decided they could leverage it as a kind of affliction, drying up life’s pleasures by revealing their bloodlessly mechanical nature.</p>

<p>Here it takes its time, catching its breath. It will wait several thousand millennia until it regains the stamina and optimism to try again. So there is no afterlife, but instead a long intermission: all of us exist inside the memory of the particle, like a fertilized egg waiting to unpack.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This is how the world will close, not with a bang but a yawn: sleepy and contented, our own falling eyelids serving as the curtain for the play’s end.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And then you are here. You are simultaneously engaged in her conversation and thinking about something else; she both gives herself to you and does not give herself to you; you find her objectionable and you deeply love her; she worships you and wonders what she might have missed with someone else. “Thank you,” you tell the angel. “This I’m used to.”</p>

<p>They watch how each human driver aims for his own private piece of the city, isolated from neighbors by layers of glass and steel.

<p>And at middle ages they talked only about their children and mortgages, making conversations in the afterlife tedious.</p>

<hr>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It feels so much like the real thing that in the afterlife you only rarely wonder whether you’ve lived all this before, haunted occasionally by déjà vu, holding a book in your hand and not knowing whether this is the first time or a replay from aeons past.</p>

<hr>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>From deep within this jungle of data they can deduce the exact dates of your various relationships: when they began, when they ended, and whether they overlapped. The Re-Creators come to understand you from every form you filled out, every word you typed on the Internet, the mail you received from others: why people thank you, who chastises you, what advice your lovers seek, what favors your friends ask. Which mailing lists you’re on. Your tax returns.</p>

<p>The death switches simulate the society so completely that the entire social network is reconstructable. The planet’s memories survive in zeros and ones.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The problem for those of us still living, however, is the increasing difficulty in determining who’s dead and who’s alive.</p>

<p>But don’t despair. We have great power to change the course of their world. Imagine that you choose to eat at a particular restaurant, where you unwillingly pass a microbe from your fingers to the saltshaker to the next person sitting at the table, who happens to board an international flight and transport the microbe to Tunisia. To the microbes, who have lost a family member, these are the mystifying and often cruel ways in which the universe works. T</p>

<p>God spends most of His time in pursuit of happiness. He reads books, strives for self-improvement, seeks activities to stave off boredom, tries to keep in touch with fading friendships, wonders if there’s something else He should be doing with His time. Over the millennia, God has grown bitter. Nothing continues to satisfy. Time drowns Him. He envies man his brief twinkling of a life, and those He dislikes are condemned to suffer immortality with Him.</p>

<p>In this way, much of your existence took place in the eyes, ears, and fingertips of others. And now that you’ve left the Earth, you are stored in scattered heads around the globe.</p>

<hr>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To understand the meaning of this afterlife, you must remember that everyone is multifaceted. And since you always lived inside your own head, you were much better at seeing the truth about others than you ever were at seeing yourself. So you navigated your life with the help of others who held up mirrors for you.</p>

<hr>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>At some point in the development of their society, these creatures began to wonder: Why are we here? What is the purpose of our existence? These turned out to be very difficult questions to answer. So difficult, in fact, that rather than attacking the questions directly, they decided it might be easier to build supercomputing machines devoted to finding the answers. So they invested the labor of tens of generations to engineer these. We are their machines.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>By careful observation of their humans over the years, they learned that sometimes couples don’t work out, that people separate, adulterate, divorce—and none of it is so terrible that the universe crashes down.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It is heartening to see that they learn from us in the same manner that all parents learn from their children.</p>

<hr>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>since we live in the heads of those who remember us, we lose control of our lives and become who they want us to be.</p>

<hr>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The cheerless woman across the way is praised as a saint, even though the roads in her heart were complicated.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The first is when the body ceases to function. The second is when the body is consigned to the grave. The third is that moment, sometime in the future, when your name is spoken for the last time.</p>

<p>So we have concluded that communicating with her is not impossible, but it is pointless.</p>

<hr>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>How could she communicate an answer back to us?</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>the world is only made up of people you’ve met before.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Communists are baffled and irritated, because they have finally achieved their perfect society, but only by the help of a God in whom they don’t want to believe. The meritocrats are abashed that they’re stuck for eternity in an incentiveless system with a bunch of pinkos. The conservatives have no penniless to disparage; the liberals have no downtrodden to promote.</p>
