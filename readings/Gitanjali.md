> When the laughters are loud, when the festive nights are gay, when I fill my rooms with decorations, let me ever feel that I have not invited thee to my house—let me not forget for a moment.  

---


> As my days pass in the crowded market of this world and my hands get full with the daily profits, let me ever feel that I have gained nothing—let me not forget for a moment.6

> You save me by denying me
the many things I want  

---


> My objects of desire,
the moment I touch them,
lose their light.
No, I want no more
what my filthy hands
have brought.
I won’t stomach anything more
unless you’re the lover:
I’ll carry myself on my own head
no longer.

> I was sitting alone, lost in thought
I was singing a song
I was sitting alone, lost in thought
I was singing a song
The tune of it reached your ears
You came to the door of my lonely house  

---


> Will moon and sun still keep you
hidden somewhere?
When will you come for your merger with me?

> So much of the unknown
you’ve made known to me
You’ve given me a place in so many homes
You’ve made the distant near, my friend,
and made the stranger a brother
So much of the unknown
you’ve made known to me
You’ve given me a place in so many homes
