## üñçÔ∏è Notes and Highlights

- üìö 

  - <mark style="background: #E6A5AB;">You are looking to the outside, and that above all you should not be doing now. Nobody can advise you and help you, nobody. There is only one way. Go into yourself.</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #E6A5AB;">For this reason, flee general subjects and take refuge in those offered by your own day-to-day life</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #B0D17F;">Works of art are infinitely solitary and</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #B0D17F;">trust yourself and your instincts; even if you go wrong in your judgement, the natural growth of your inner life will gradually, over time, lead you to other insights.</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">These things cannot be measured by time, a year has no meaning, and ten years are nothing. To be an artist means: not to calculate and count;</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #B0D17F;">And that we receive this pleasure cannot be a bad thing; what is bad is the way almost all of us misuse the experience and waste it and</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #B0D17F;">apply it as a stimulus to the tired parts of our lives, as a distraction instead of as a concentration of ourselves into climactic points</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">Oh if only mankind could embrace this mystery, which penetrates the earth right into its smallest elements</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">and be assured and gentle with them and do not plague them with your doubts or frighten them with your confidence or your joyfulness, which they cannot understand.</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #E6A5AB;">Look for some kind of simple and loyal way of being together with them which does not necessarily have to alter however much you may change</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #E6A5AB;">People have tended (with the help of conventions) to resolve everything in the direction of easiness, of the light, and</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #EDD570;">It is good to be alone, for solitude is difficult; that something is difficult should be one more reason to do it.</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #E6A5AB;">so too we shall gradually learn to recognize that what we call fate originates in ourselves, in humankind, and does not work on us from the outside.</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">The future is fixed, dear Mr Kappus, but we move around in infinite space.</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">We must accept our existence in as wide a sense as can be; everything, even the unheard-of, must be possible within it.</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #E6A5AB;">That, when you come down to it, is the only kind of courage that is demanded of us: the courage for the oddest, the most unexpected, the most inexplicable things that we may encounter.</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #E6A5AB;">We have no reason to be mistrustful of our world, for it is not against us. If it holds terrors they are our terrors, if it has its abysses these abysses belong to us, if there are dangers then we must try to</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">Perhaps everything terrifying i</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #B0D17F;">deep down a helpless thing that needs our help.</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #C4B3D9;">Why should you want to exclude from your life all unsettling, all pain, all depression of spirit, when you don‚Äôt know what work it</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #C4B3D9;">is these states are performing within you?</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #B0D17F;">Why do you want to persecute yourself with the question of where it all comes from and where it is leading?</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">But with all illnesses there are many days when the doctor can do nothing but wait.</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #C4B3D9;">Do not watch yourself too closely. Do not draw over-rapid conclusions from what is happening to you.</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">do not think that the person who is trying to console you lives effortlessly among the simple, quiet words that sometimes make you feel better. His life is full of troubles and sadness and falls far short of them. But if it were any different he could never have found the words that he did.</mark>

  - <mark style="background: #B0D17F;">And otherwise let life take its course. Believe me: life i</mark>
