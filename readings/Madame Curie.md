> I shall never know how to act at the opportune moment.

> They tell me one of the professors may perhaps resign and that in case he does I should submit my candidature as his successor. It is a nasty job being a candidate for any place at all, and I am not accustomed to this sort of exercise, demoralizing in the highest degree. I am sorry I spoke of it to you. I believe there is nothing more unhealthy for the mind than to allow one’s self to be preoccupied with such matters.

> MARIE HAD RULED LOVE and marriage out of her life’s program. There was nothing extremely original in that.  

---


> When one is young and solitary and swallowed up in study, one can “not have enough to live on”—and yet live to the fullest.  

---


> She was proud of her poverty; proud of living alone and independent in a foreign city.  

---


> One never notices what has been done; one can only see what remains to be done, and if one didn’t like the work it would be very discouraging.  

---


> And as for me, it is my whole life that is at stake.

> All the rooms Marie was to inhabit were alike in discomfort and cheapness of rent. The first was situated in a poorly furnished house where students, doctors and officers of the neighboring garrison lived.  

---


> By deliberate intention she had suppressed diversions from her schedule, as well as friendly meetings and contact with human beings.  

---


> Father is beginning to speak of her a little too tenderly, and I am afraid that he will be forgetting me soon  

---


> She forgot her terrors: terror of the oppressor, religious terrors, terror of illness and death. Instinctively she tried to escape from a “climate” too heavy for her.  

---


> But Manya had remained unmoved. She did not know how to be angry, but neither could she be amused at a trick which had frightened her. Her ash-gray eyes expressed the stupor of a sleepwalker suddenly jerked out of her dream.
