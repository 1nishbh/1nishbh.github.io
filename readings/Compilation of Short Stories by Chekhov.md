men, who showed a friendly disposition towards me; from my conversations
with them I could understand that their work was controlled not so much by
their own intelligence and free choice as by fashion and the mood of the
public. The best of them had had to play in their day in tragedy, in
operetta, in Parisian farces, and in extravaganzas, and they always seemed
equally sure that they were on the right path and that they were of use.
So, as you see, the cause of the evil must be sought, not in the actors,
but, more deeply, in the art itself and in the attitude of the whole of

soul.  

---


> “Is it the proper thing for gentlefolk to be disorderly in the
street?” a policeman said to him. “You had better go into a
tavern!”

shoemaker!”

regretting that the girl was not mine, and never would be, or that I was a
stranger to her; or whether I vaguely felt that her rare beauty was
