# 📔 Book: The Myth of Sisyphus

**Author**:: Albert Camus

**LANGUAGE**:: en-US


## 🧾 Description
One of the most influential works of this century, The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays is a crucial exposition of existentialist thought. Influenced by works such as Don Juan and the novels of Kafka, these essays begin with a meditation on suicide; the question of living or not living in a universe devoid of order or meaning. With lyric eloquence, Albert Camus brilliantly posits a way out of despair, reaffirming the value of personal existence, and the possibility of life lived with dignity and authenticity.

## Notes and Highlights

- 📚
	- <mark style="background: #B0D17F;">We get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of thinking</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #A8BADE;"> But practically I know men and recognize them by their behavior, by the totality of their deeds, by the consequences caused in life by their presence.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #E6A5AB;">You describe it to me and you teach me to classify it. You enumerate its laws and in my thirst for knowledge I admit that they are true. You take apart its mechanism and my hope increases. At the final stage you teach me that this wondrous and multicolored universe can be reduced to the atom and that the atom itself can be reduced to the electron. All this is good and I wait for you to continue. But you tell me of an invisible planetary system in which electrons gravitate around a nucleus. You explain this world to me with an image. I realize then that you have been reduced to poetry: I shall never know.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #C4B3D9;">This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #E6A5AB;">But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #E65747;"> The world itself, whose single meaning I do not understand, is but a vast irrational.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">But these men vie with one another in proclaiming that nothing is clear, all is chaos, that all man has is his lucidity and his definite knowledge of the walls surrounding him.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #C4B3D9;">This is why I cannot get lost in the glorification or the mere definition of a notion which eludes me and loses its meaning as soon as it goes beyond the frame of reference of my individual experience. I cannot understand what kind of freedom would be given me by a higher being. I have lost the sense of hierarchy.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">Before encountering the absurd, the everyday man lives with aims, a concern for the future or for justification (with regard to whom or what is not the question). He weighs his chances, he counts on “someday,” his retirement or the labor of his sons. He still thinks that something in his life can be directed.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #EDD570;">But after the absurd, everything is upset. That idea that “I am,” my way of acting as if everything has a meaning (even if, on occasion, I said that nothing has)—all that is given the lie in vertiginous fashion by the absurdity of a possible death. Thinking of the future, establishing aims for oneself, having preferences—all this presupposes a belief in freedom, even if one occasionally ascertains that one doesn’t feel it. But at that moment I am well aware that that higher liberty, that freedom to be, which alone can serve as basis for a truth, does not exist. Death is there as the only reality. After death the chips are down. I am not even free, either, to perpetuate myself, but a slave, and, above all, a slave without hope of an eternal revolution, without recourse to contempt.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #E6A5AB;">If I convince myself that this life has no other aspect than that of the absurd, if I feel that its whole equilibrium depends on that perpetual opposition between my conscious revolt and the darkness in which it struggles, if I admit that my freedom has no meaning except in relation to its limited fate, then I must say that what counts is not the best living but the most living.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #C4B3D9;">It clearly seems that the chief thing in heaven and on earth is to obey at length and in a single direction: in the long run there results something for which it is worth the trouble of living on this earth as, for example, virtue, art, music, the dance, reason, the mind—something that transfigures, something delicate, mad, or divine</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #B0D17F;">Obeying the flame is both the easiest and the hardest thing to do.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #C4B3D9;">But it is bad to stop, hard to be satisfied with a single way of seeing, to go without contradiction, perhaps the most subtle of all spiritual forces. The preceding merely defines a way of thinking. But the point is to live.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">Collecting” amounts to being capable of living off one’s past.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">A man is more a man through the things he keeps to himself than through those he says.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">wonderful unattached state you understand why I exalt and crush him at one and the same time.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #A8BADE;"> I establish my lucidity in the midst of what negates it. I exalt man before what crushes him, and my freedom, my revolt, and my passion come together then in that tension, that lucidity, and that vast repetition.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">The imagination can add many others, inseparable from time and exile, who likewise know how to live in harmony with a universe without future and without weakness.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #B0D17F;">This absurd, godless world is, then, peopled with men who think clearly and have ceased to hope. And I have not yet spoken of the most absurd character, who is the creator.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #B0D17F;">A man wants to earn money in order to be happy, and his whole effort and the best of a life are devoted to the earning of that money. Happiness is forgotten; the means are taken for the end.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #E6A5AB;">Likewise, the whole effort of this conqueror will be diverted to ambition, which was but a way toward a greater life.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">t. But in reality it is a matter of annexing Christ. Kirilov in fact fancies for a moment that Jesus at his death did not find himself in Paradise. He found out then that his torture had been useless. “The laws of nature,” says the engineer, “made Christ live in the midst of falsehood and die for a falsehood.” Solely in this sense Jesus indeed personifies the whole human drama. He is the complete man, being the one who realized the most absurd condition. He is not the God-man but the man-god. And, like him, each of us can be crucified and victimized—and is to a certain degree.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #B0D17F;">They need to be shown the way and cannot do without preaching.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #E6A5AB;">He must give the void its colors.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #A8BADE;">But perhaps the great work of art has less importance in itself than in the ordeal it demands of a man and the opportunity it provides him of overcoming his phantoms and approaching a little closer to his naked reality.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #E6A5AB;">To create is likewise to give a shape to one’s fate. For all these characters, their work defines them at least as much as it is defined by them. The actor taught us this: there is no frontier between being and appearing.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #C4B3D9;">A face that toils so close to stones is already stone itself!</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #C4B3D9;">If this myth is tragic, that is because its hero is conscious.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #C4B3D9;">It drives out of this world a god who had come into it with dissatisfaction and a preference for futile sufferings. It makes of fate a human matter, which must be settled among men.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #B0D17F;">I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one’s burden again.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #B0D17F;">the strangeness of a man’s life and the simplicity with which that man accepts it.</mark>


	- <mark style="background: #B0D17F;"> A moment comes when the creation ceases to be taken tragically; it is merely taken seriously. Then man is concerned with hope. But that is not his business. His business is to turn away from subterfuge.</mark>
