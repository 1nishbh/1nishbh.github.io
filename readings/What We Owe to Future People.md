> They are not here for us to ask them what they could reasonably reject, and conditions may change dramatically over time such that it becomes difficult to predict to what a person might reasonably object one hundred years from now. One option is to adopt a trustee model whereby we take into account objections that could be raised by someone on behalf of another person.

> [A]ny actual human being . . . whether existing now or only at some point past or future time, constitutes a point of view relative to which the question of justifiability makes sense, and we have reason to value the justifiability of our actions to these people—that is to say, to those who are already dead, or are not yet born, as well as to our contemporaries.  

---


> The focus on equal moral status and respect means that it will likely not be a significant problem to explain why the theory can extend to future people since no actual interaction or reciprocity is required.  

---


> In contractualism people are not aggregated in order to determine the value of certain principles. Rather, each person’s life and objections are taken into account.  

---


> Scope-as-sphere: what areas of morality does the theory cover?
Scope-as-agents: Who does the theory apply to?

> Essentially, increases or decreases in well-being can be offered as reasons in favour of or in objection to a principle, but well-being does not function as a sort of supreme value, against which all principles are evaluated. Rather, it is just one element that is drawn upon in support of or against moral principles.  

---


> For example, if the enslavement of a particular race were currently permitted and a principle were considered that would prohibit it, current slave owners could not reasonably reject it simply on the basis of their reduced well-being. They would certainly be made worse off by the principle, but others (in particular, the slaves) are made much worse off by an alternative principle that permits it.

> It is neither necessary nor always sufficient that a principle negatively affects a person’s well-being in order for it to be reasonably rejected. It is not necessary because a person could reject a principle even though it did not negatively affect his well-being. In other words, reasons other than an impact on well-being can be offered in objection to a principle. Such reasons include unfairness or arbitrariness, or other background entitlements such as rights. In James Woodward’s example, a Black man is denied boarding on an airplane because of the colour of his skin. The plane ultimately crashes, killing all those on board. In this case the man’s well-being was not negatively affected all things considered (in fact, he may even have been benefited), but he could still reasonably reject any principle that allowed the airline to deny him boarding on the basis of his race.54 His objection to this principle would likely be based on the fact that it was discriminatory and arbitrary and failed to recognise him as an equal moral agent.

> The focus of contractualism is the standpoint of individuals, not those of aggregated individuals or groups. In other words, a person must object to a principle on their own behalf, not on behalf of a group. This prevents interpersonal aggregation and ensures that a number of smaller complaints cannot outweigh a very weighty burden a single person could face.

> For example, a certain brand of utilitarian could argue that a healthy person ought to donate all of their organs (and by consequence their life) to save the lives of six others because the net total utility that is gained is higher than if the healthy person kept their organs and the six others died. The reason that could be offered in favour of the donation would have to be given on behalf of the six and would stem from the aggregated benefit the group would enjoy. However, contractualism would not allow the strong reason the healthy person has to want to keep their organs to be outweighed by the aggregation of each one of the six’s individually smaller reasons.

> If I wish to break a promise I made to my friend to go to the cinema with her, I must be able to offer good reasons for this. Perhaps I encountered a person in need of rescue on the way, or I have caught the flu and feel too ill to go out. Likewise, I must consider what reasons she could have for rejecting a principle that allowed me to break my promise. She might, for example, have been in need of cheering up and will be very disappointed if I cancel our plans. We can act wrongly either by acting according to unacceptable reasons (reasons that are disallowed, or to which we have given too much weight), or by failing to consider the reasons that others might have to reject our action.

> In everyday life, when we ask a person to ‘please be reasonable!’ we are asking them to take others’ interests into account when forming judgements about what to do.   

---


>  First, it must avoid ad hoc motivational assumptions that explain why we choose to fulfill our obligations to the future.   

---


> Mulgan thinks we can avoid this result only by denying that there are lives that are not worth living. Since a life worth living is something that people generally enjoy and possible people would desire, it seems reasonable to say that for the possible people in the original position existence above the threshold at which a life becomes worth living is preferable to non-existence. If a party in the original position did not know if they would exist or not, they would therefore presumably choose a principle that maximised their probability of existing as long as they were above the threshold at which a life is worth living.

> People will choose to save out of self-interest because they would not want to be part of a generation that came late in a chain of non-saving generations.  

---


> However, neither (2) nor (2*) explains the source of an obligation to refrain from actions that would not hurt the very next generations, but whose consequences will not be felt until several generations down the line (what Brian Barry called ‘sleepers’)  

---


>  The parties care about the welfare of their immediate descendants, so every person in the original position cares about somebody and every person in the generation that follows has somebody who cares about them.17 But why are the parties not able to have concern for other people when dealing with contemporaries but are able to carry such a concern for others when considering intergenerational justice?

> growth remains constant or increases, this would require earlier (poorer) generations to save for the benefit of later (wealthier) ones. Such a thought would be inconsistent with the spirit of the rest of Rawls’ theory of justice, which gives priority to the worst-off because requiring the poorer, earlier generations to save would actually be giving priority to the best-off.  

---


> Whereas Scanlon asks what others could reasonably reject, Rawls seeks the set of principles that everybody would accept under the conditions of the veil of ignorance and general mutual disinterest.  

---


> There is an intuitive moral objection to actions that cause people to have only barely-worth-living lives, especially when the burdens in question were avoidable.
  

---


> The non-identity problem is a challenge to accounts of obligations to the future because it suggests that we cannot harm people in the future unless it is the case that the people who are created will exist regardless of what actions we take  

---


> Non-Identity Problem: If an action we perform causes a person to exist with a very bad but still barely-worth-living life, our action has not harmed him since if we had not performed it, he would never have existed.  

---


> ‘Who would I be if my parents had married other people?’ is obviously ‘no one.’9 Quite simply, if your mother had conceived with a man other than your father, you would not exist. Someone would exist, but they would not be you.  

---


> This approach regards the treatment of future people as if it were no different from that of contemporaries. The potential problem with this approach is that there are a number of ways in which the situation of future people is quite different, and so one might reasonably wonder whether we really can just apply the theories we use intragenerationally to the intergenerational context.
  

---


> The seemingly simple question ‘What do we owe to future people?’ actually contains a number of different questions, including what principle(s) of justice, if any, apply over time, and to whom. But it also extends beyond considerations of justice to include other moral ideals such as basic humanitarian duties and the value of promoting good states of affairs that are not necessarily considered to be matters of ‘justice’. For example, it might be thought that it would be bad if humans became extinct, but it could not be said to be unjust since there is no one to whom or for whom it is unjust or unfair.3 So we may believe that we ought not to choose principles that result in the end of the human species, but the objection to such principles would not arise from a claim about injustice.
  

---


> It is crucial to understand what it is we owe to future people in terms of both providing benefits (e.g., a good environment) and preventing burdens (e.g., large public debts).  

---


> Intergenerational ethics is not just philosophically interesting; it is also of great practical importance, especially given human beings’ ability to affect the quality of life of the people who will inhabit the world in the future.
