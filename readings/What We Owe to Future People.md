> There is an intuitive moral objection to actions that cause people to have only barely-worth-living lives, especially when the burdens in question were avoidable.
  

---


> The non-identity problem is a challenge to accounts of obligations to the future because it suggests that we cannot harm people in the future unless it is the case that the people who are created will exist regardless of what actions we take

> Non-Identity Problem: If an action we perform causes a person to exist with a very bad but still barely-worth-living life, our action has not harmed him since if we had not performed it, he would never have existed.

> ‘Who would I be if my parents had married other people?’ is obviously ‘no one.’9 Quite simply, if your mother had conceived with a man other than your father, you would not exist. Someone would exist, but they would not be you.

> This approach regards the treatment of future people as if it were no different from that of contemporaries. The potential problem with this approach is that there are a number of ways in which the situation of future people is quite different, and so one might reasonably wonder whether we really can just apply the theories we use intragenerationally to the intergenerational context.

> The seemingly simple question ‘What do we owe to future people?’ actually contains a number of different questions, including what principle(s) of justice, if any, apply over time, and to whom. But it also extends beyond considerations of justice to include other moral ideals such as basic humanitarian duties and the value of promoting good states of affairs that are not necessarily considered to be matters of ‘justice’. For example, it might be thought that it would be bad if humans became extinct, but it could not be said to be unjust since there is no one to whom or for whom it is unjust or unfair.3 So we may believe that we ought not to choose principles that result in the end of the human species, but the objection to such principles would not arise from a claim about injustice.

> It is crucial to understand what it is we owe to future people in terms of both providing benefits (e.g., a good environment) and preventing burdens (e.g., large public debts).

> Intergenerational ethics is not just philosophically interesting; it is also of great practical importance, especially given human beings’ ability to affect the quality of life of the people who will inhabit the world in the future.
