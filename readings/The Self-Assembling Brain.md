>  But without sufficient airtime, some theories, however correct, may have gotten buried in scientific history.   

---


> I highly recommend reading Cajal’s and Golgi’s speeches for the same prize in 1906,  

---


> The question about memory is simple enough. How is memory stored and how is it retrieved?  

---


> But to decide what is not needed, it helps to at least know what it is we are choosing to not know.  

---


> The idea that information unfolding based on genomic information cannot be mathematically calculated, but instead requires algorithmic growth or a full simulation thereof, is a core hypothesis of this book.  

---


> If there is no way to read the genetic code other than running it, then we are principally unable to predict exact outcomes with any analytical method of the code.  

---


> A specific step may not have been possible before and may not be possible ever again.  

---


> Genetic information allows brains to grow. Development progresses in time and requires energy. Step by step, the developing brain finds itself in changing configurations. Each configuration serves as a new basis for the next step in the growth process. At each step, bits of the genome are activated to produce gene products that themselves change what parts of the genome will be activated next—a continuous feedback process between the genome and its products.  

---


> But there is no blueprint for brain connectivity in the genes. There is also no such information coming from the environment.  

---


> Common analogies for brain wiring include circuit diagrams of modern microprocessors, the electrical wiring installations in skyscrapers or the logistics of transportation networks in big cities.
