    "text": "[[Biases]] - External Validation\nIf you don't have any urge or necessity to introduce yourself and seek others to like or approve you, you have accomplished much more than a Sadhguru. [[when you can see the \"farce of resurrection and entombment\" and decide not to participate in it?]]\n\n[[The issue with validation is it has massive normalizing power: your professors/parents/advisors want to enshrine ideologies that they know works the best, but following those dogmas make you feel safe and valued though there is no value—just validation that you're the just another rat in the rat race.]]\n\n[[Install an operating assumption that nobody you meet today or the day after or before cares about you until proven otherwise.]] ^5cc3a0\n[[the only difference b/w unemployed and entrepreneur is just a mindset.]] # [[Heuristics ]]\n\n\nIf a person is so much engrossed into the mainstream items or ideas, he might not be the good person to talk with.\nIf a person acts of being certain about everything, might not be a good person to share about doubts or to have a discourse on life. ^c87ef7\nAvoid people who hate other people just because they’re rich or poor, good or bad looking.\n“[[If you need money, ask for advice. If you need advice, ask for money.]]” - [[Peter Thiel]]\nPiss enough people off. [[Always seek for constructive criticism that’s what puts you into map and be more unapologetic or apologetic about yourself.]] [[Mental Models]]\nTruths don’t hurt or haunt you; they liberate, uplift you. If it seems to be the other way around, think clearly, deeply, and independently."
