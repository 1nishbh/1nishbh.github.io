In the bookstore you‚Äôll see one of them arm in arm with the affectionate woman whom you let slip away.\n\n\n\nIf you assume this gift of revelation is received in Heaven, you‚Äôre only half right; it is also the punishment designed for you in Hell. The Rewarders originally thought to offer it as a gift, but the Punishers quickly decided they could leverage it as a kind of affliction, drying up life‚Äôs pleasures by revealing their bloodlessly mechanical nature.\n\n\n\nimperturbable capacity to hold the beliefs with which they arrived, a deep reluctance to consider evidence that separates them from their lifelong context.\n\n\n\nHere it takes its time, catching its breath. It will wait several thousand millennia until it regains the stamina and optimism to try again. So there is no afterlife, but instead a long intermission: all of us exist inside the memory of the particle, like a fertilized egg waiting to unpack.\n\n\n\nThis is how the world will close, not with a bang but a yawn: sleepy and contented, our own falling eyelids serving as the curtain for the play‚Äôs end.\n\n\n\nAnd then you are here. You are simultaneously engaged in her conversation and thinking about something else; she both gives herself to you and does not give herself to you; you find her objectionable and you deeply love her; she worships you and wonders what she might have missed with someone else. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù you tell the angel. ‚ÄúThis I‚Äôm used to.‚Äù\n\n\n\ntourist sitting across from her, and onward the computation evolves.\n\n\n\nThis surge of neural activity causes you immediately to release pheromones that are consciously undetectable but have considerable influence on the nervous system of the young woman sitting next to you: moments later, she unwittingly taps her left foot, once.

Some of the humans reach out to make cell phone contact with a single friend out of the innumerable hordes. And gazing out over the steering wheel, each human feels the intensities of joy and grief\n\n\n\nWhen they feel overwhelmed by their own struggles, they sit down and observe a traffic jam.\n\n\n\nbut they find themselves continually stymied by the personalized nature of their goals.\n\n\n\neverything interesting happens at the borders between domains of power.\n\n\n\nWhen soldiers part ways at war‚Äôs end, the breakup of the platoon triggers the same emotion as the death of a person\n\n\n\nthese different identities, was like a bundle of sticks from different trees.\n\n\n\nThese reunions reveal a group of individuals touchingly searching for a common theme.

The Re-Creators come to understand you from every form you filled out, every word you typed on the Internet, the mail you received from others: why people thank you, who chastises you, what advice your lovers seek, what favors your friends ask. Which mailing lists you‚Äôre on. Your tax returns.\n\n\n\nThe death switches simulate the society so completely that the entire social network is reconstructable. The planet‚Äôs memories survive in zeros and ones.\n\n\n\nThe problem for those of us still living, however, is the increasing difficulty in determining who‚Äôs dead and who‚Äôs alive.\n\n\n\nToday, building a death switch to pretend you are not dead has become an art form.\n\n\n\nIt appears I‚Äôm dead now,‚Äù the email would begin. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take this as an opportunity to tell you things I‚Äôve always wanted to express ‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n\n\nOther times the instructions include something quite specific: you are to mention somewhere in the conversation the title of a new book, or drop the name of a mutual friend.\n\n\n\nBut, instead, we all watch for one thing: evidence of our residual influence in the world, the ripples left in our wake\n\n\n\nWhatever lies behind His absence, it hasn‚Äôt taken long for the garden to degrade into a Hobbesian jungle.\n\n\n\nBut don‚Äôt despair. We have great power to change the course of their world. Imagine that you choose to eat at a particular restaurant, where you unwillingly pass a microbe from your fingers to the saltshaker to the next person sitting at the table, who happens to board an international flight and transport the microbe to Tunisia. To the microbes, who have lost a family member, these are the mystifying and often cruel ways in which the universe works.

He reads books, strives for self-improvement, seeks activities to stave off boredom, tries to keep in touch with fading friendships, wonders if there‚Äôs something else He should be doing with His time. Over the millennia, God has grown bitter. Nothing continues to satisfy. Time drowns Him. He envies man his brief twinkling of a life, and those He dislikes are condemned to suffer immortality with Him.\n\n\n\nIn this way, much of your existence took place in the eyes, ears, and fingertips of others. And now that you‚Äôve left the Earth, you are stored in scattered heads around the globe.\n\n\n\nTo understand the meaning of this afterlife, you must remember that everyone is multifaceted. And since you always lived inside your own head, you were much better at seeing the truth about others than you ever were at seeing yourself.

What is the purpose of our existence? These turned out to be very difficult questions to answer. So difficult, in fact, that rather than attacking the questions directly, they decided it might be easier to build supercomputing machines devoted to finding the answers. So they invested the labor of tens of generations to engineer these. We are their machines.\n\n\n\nBy careful observation of their humans over the years, they learned that sometimes couples don‚Äôt work out, that people separate, adulterate, divorce‚Äîand none of it is so terrible that the universe crashes down.\n\n\n\nIt is heartening to see that they learn from us in the same manner that all parents learn from their children.\n\n\n\nsince we live in the heads of those who remember us, we lose control of our lives and become who they want us to be.\n\n\n\nThe cheerless woman across the way is praised as a saint, even though the roads in her heart were complicated.\n\n\n\nThe first is when the body ceases to function.

The city dweller finds the keen edge of hospitality blunted by a superabundance of strange faces."

It is a nasty job being a candidate for any place at all, and I am not accustomed to this sort of exercise, demoralizing in the highest degree. I am sorry I spoke of it to you. I believe there is nothing more unhealthy for the mind than to allow one‚Äôs self to be preoccupied with such matters.\n\n\n\nMARIE HAD RULED LOVE and marriage out of her life‚Äôs program. There was nothing extremely original in that.\n\n\n\nWhen one is young and solitary and swallowed up in study, one can ‚Äúnot have enough to live on‚Äù‚Äîand yet live to the fullest.\n\n\n\nShe was proud of her poverty; proud of living alone and independent in a foreign city.\n\n\n\nOne never notices what has been done; one can only see what remains to be done, and if one didn‚Äôt like the work it would be very discouraging.\n\n\n\nAnd as for me, it is my whole life that is at stake.\n\n\n\nAll the rooms Marie was to inhabit were alike in discomfort and cheapness of rent. The first was situated in a poorly furnished house where students, doctors and officers of the neighboring garrison lived.\n\n\n\nBy deliberate intention she had suppressed diversions from her schedule, as well as friendly meetings and contact with human beings.\n\n\n\nFather is beginning to speak of her a little too tenderly, and I am afraid that he will be forgetting me soon\n\n\n\nShe forgot her terrors: terror of the oppressor, religious terrors, terror of illness and death. Instinctively she tried to escape from a ‚Äúclimate‚Äù too heavy for her.\n\n\n\nBut Manya had remained unmoved. She did not know how to be angry, but neither could she be amused at a trick which had frightened her. Her ash-gray eyes expressed the stupor of a sleepwalker suddenly jerked out of her dream."

    "text": "We are all slaves at least of our affections, slaves of the prejudices of those we love; we must also earn our living, and thereby become a part of the machine, etc., etc.\n\n\n\nI shall never know how to act at the opportune moment.\n\n\n\nThey tell me one of the professors may perhaps resign and that in case he does I should submit my candidature as his successor. It is a nasty job being a candidate for any place at all, and I am not accustomed to this sort of exercise, demoralizing in the highest degree. I am sorry I spoke of it to you. I believe there is nothing more unhealthy for the mind than to allow one‚Äôs self to be preoccupied with such matters.\n\n\n\nMARIE HAD RULED LOVE and marriage out of her life‚Äôs program. There was nothing extremely original in that.\n\n\n\nWhen one is young and solitary and swallowed up in study, one can ‚Äúnot have enough to live on‚Äù‚Äîand yet live to the fullest.\n\n\n\nShe was proud of her poverty; proud of living alone and independent in a foreign city.\n\n\n\nOne never notices what has been done; one can only see what remains to be done, and if one didn‚Äôt like the work it would be very discouraging.\n\n\n\nAnd as for me, it is my whole life that is at stake.\n\n\n\nAll the rooms Marie was to inhabit were alike in discomfort and cheapness of rent. The first was situated in a poorly furnished house where students, doctors and officers of the neighboring garrison lived.\n\n\n\nBy deliberate intention she had suppressed diversions from her schedule, as well as friendly meetings and contact with human beings.\n\n\n\nFather is beginning to speak of her a little too tenderly, and I am afraid that he will be forgetting me soon\n\n\n\nShe forgot her terrors: terror of the oppressor, religious terrors, terror of illness and death. Instinctively she tried to escape from a ‚Äúclimate‚Äù too heavy for her.\n\n\n\nBut Manya had remained unmoved. She did not know how to be angry, but neither could she be amused at a trick which had frightened her. Her ash-gray eyes expressed the stupor of a sleepwalker suddenly jerked out of her dream."
