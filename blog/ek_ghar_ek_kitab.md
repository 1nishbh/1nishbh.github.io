## Ek Ghar Ek Kitab 

The aim is to provide books to a remote village in Rolpa. 

- A unique book for each household.
- The exchange of books will be prioritized once the students have finished reading the book they received during the distribution.
- a village with 100 households will have 100 different books, for example. a person should easily be able to read more than 5 books a year through exchanges. 
- If nobody in a household has started reading the book and a person from another household has finished the originally given book, the person who completed the book should be entitled to an exchange. 
- The database of books and their initial recipients can be published, but there is no need to keep it updated. 

### Genres and Scope of Books
-  a mix of non-fiction and fiction, maybe 80:20.
-  translated and original Nepali works, with maybe 10-20% English books.
- The target audience is students in grades 5 to 10.
