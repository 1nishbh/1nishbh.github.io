## Ek Ghar Ek Kitab 

The idea is to gift books to a remote village in Rolpa. 
- buy different book for each house
- prioritize the exchange of books once the students are done reading the one that they got at the time of distribution.
- in nutshell, a village with 100 house will have 100 different books. So a person might actually be able to read >5 books a year through exchanges. 
- if nobody at a house has started reading the book and a person from another house has finished the originally given book, the person who completed the book should be entitled an exchange. 
- the database of books and who has been given which one initially can be published. but no need to keep updating. 

### genres and scope of book
- mix of non-fiction and fiction: maybe 80-20
- translated and original nepali works (maybe 10 percent english books)
- targetted public is students in grades 5 to 10.
