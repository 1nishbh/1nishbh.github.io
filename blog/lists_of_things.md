------------------------------------------------------------------------

if one sets out to make a personal list of things that matter to them, i wonder what would be the ones worth curating.

for instance, **list of** ---\
1. books to read, books read, most re-read books, self-authored best poems\
2. movies to watch, albums to listen, playlists\
3. favorite artists, scientists, politicians, activists, writers\
4. questions to ask oneself, unsolved problems, biases ...

let's consider this list, for exaxple, [Those Weirdos Who Help Make Life Worth Living](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/hellaguru/those-weirdos-who-help-make-life-worth-living/) on RYM

or what if you're making a list of questions that you can ask yourself when you're stuck in a hopeless situation?

>For a starter, what would X do? Or, how often do I come in my own way, and how? or am i burnt-out? should i take a break or quit or go mad? 😀

worth noting that if one feels pressured to make a list of all the happenings in the town, it would be counterproductive, but having a mindful list of things that matter greatly to you, especially list of things that you will engage with and update over a sustained period of time, would help you to track the evolution of your taste and style, rather than being just a thoughtless consumer of immediate, mass-produced trends or just being just an "influenced man"---the man of mere circumstances.

if you're a researcher, what kind of lists would you make?

>the list of your favorite:\
`unsolved problems,`\
`or solved problems`,\
`or the questions to ask?`
`or the research niche/labs/conferences`
