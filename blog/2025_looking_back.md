## 2025 looking back

went to San Juan Puerto Rico\
collaborated across projects\
got my driving license, *yet didn't get enough experience on the wheels*\
presented some part of my work in a local conference at cshl\

> applied to 25 under 25 Nepalaya’s writing review\
> selected under short story\
> *point to be noted that such 25 under 25, under 30, etc are artificial metrics; over time they become irrelevant. nature has no such buckets.*

> also completed a book of poems; will consider to publish them enrolled in a script-writing workshop and produced a compelling script. **thinking of submitting this to AFF** watch handful of movies - sentimental value is probably my best of 2025 applied to graduate schools\
> interviewed for two; no final offer yet

> went to boston with friends
