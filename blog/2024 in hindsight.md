### Snapshots
- went to farwest-nepal
- graduated
- wrote stuffs; consistently.
- enrolled in a research position at cshl
- moved to a new city; such a quiet neighborhood. 
- visited boston. kind of liked the vibe.
- didn't learn driving
- was confused half of the time whether to pursue a graduate program in the future and confused about the type of work to contribute to the rest of the time.
	- well, def exaggerating at the expense of sounding poetic
- went hiking to the upstate (breakneck ride, bull hill, and little excursions in cold spring village etc)
### findings
- absolutely loved the filmography of Turkish film director **Nuri Ceylan**.  overall, such subtleties of everyday life dissected into scenes–scenes so natural and gnawing and awe-inspiring.  ==oh damn felt so seen and autopsied by the *the wild pear tree*.==
-  loved the **'what we owe to the future'** by William MacAskill which expand on the contractualism put forward by T.M. Scanlon but in the intergenerational ( non-overlapping generations) context. will probably reread. Also enjoyed the Sum:forty tales from afterlives, letters to a young poet, joy of x,  exhalation stories, and wuthering heights. 
	- i did lost my bag in Boston that had books and other stuffs. life has not changed much without the bag and its belonging. 
- read works from Nepali literature too: BP Koirala's Sumnima (tug of war bw spiritual and physical dimensions of human beings) and Bhupi Sherchan's Ghumne Mech Mathi Andho Manchhe.
- cancer is tough, so is neuroscience, so is AI. and the interestingness seem to evaporate with deeper exposure to current pursuits in the field? is it filtering mechanism/test implemented by a field by adapting a high barrier for entry, or a lack of personal commitment, or lack of understanding about the fundamentals of the field? 

### back to the future
- pick a city
- apply to grad programs
	- simultaneously apply to jobs, for u never know what kind of loser u can turn out to be
	- find a good professor who can teach you skills in academia and beyond
		- personality + lab values >> research papers
- learn driving! oh, common! 
- explore new places ????
- ŵritë and submit
